 * A Unix domain socket or IPC socket (inter-process communication socket)
 * is a data communications endpoint for exchanging data between processes
 * executing within the same host operating system. While similar in
 * functionality to named pipes, Unix domain sockets may be created
 * as connectionâ€‘mode (SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_SEQPACKET) or as connectionless
 * (SOCK_DGRAM), while pipes are streams only. Processes using Unix domain
 * sockets do not need to share a common ancestry.
 * 
 * Unix domain sockets use the file system as their address name space.
 * They are referenced by processes as inodes in the file system.
 * This allows two processes to open the same socket in order to communicate.
 * However, communication occurs entirely within the operating system kernel.
 * In addition to sending data, processes may send file descriptors across
 * a Unix domain socket connection using the sendmsg() and recvmsg() system
 * calls.
